## who... _are you?_

- üëãüèª cory, general guy
- üëãüèª chris, genreal guy

---
## ready-check!

- bloopers, queued
- donut-monster, growling
- hacks, hacking
- stories, telling
- jerks, crushed (i.e. little server worker buddies)

---
### why?

- science!

---
### go on...

<img src="./img/brain.svg" class="brain" />

- brains
- research
- can't share data easily
  - heavy
  - slow
  - against irb orders
  - evil doers, reverse engineering

---

### so what did we do?

- built a distributed Machine Learning system

---
### what?

- we wanted to show it off!
- they researched "what factors contribute to Schizophrenia?"
- we researched "what factors make donuts most delicious?"

---

### why donuts

- were here to show you... how to make a donut, _and_
- share some tinkering with DonutLearning‚Ñ¢

---
### but we left

- so we won't show you the real deal
- we will show you a simpler demo!

--

### so _how do you make a donut?_

- <code>CODE!</code>

---
### lets make donuts!

<a id="open-donuts" href="https://donuts.cdaringe.com">donuts.cdaringe.com</a>
- keep it open!

---

### what makes a donut delicious?

---
### DonutLearn‚Ñ¢ Time
---
### what's happening here?

- you send us donuts
- we compute a mathmatical model/equation
  - regression _learns_ an equation that explains deliciousness
  - _f(donut) = delicious-ness-score_
- we some ML goodness to maximize that equation
- we send back down our best guess to the UI

---
# bloopers

- open VLC, dawg.
 - `open img/bloopers`
- bulk select and open w/

---

### plugs

- **math**.
- [cleaver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cleaver)
  - it's like a real simple stupid revealjs
- [scikit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
- [docker](http://docker.com), obviously.  such great.
- [coinstac](https://github.com/MRN-Code/coinstac/)
- `create-react-app`!

---

### anti-plugs, kinda

- **dockerode**
  - great, but tricky!

### questions?
